    <p>Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct</p>

    <p>Our Pledge</p>
    <p>
      In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
      contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project
      and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of
      age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
      identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic
      status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual
      identity and orientation.
    </p>

    <p>Our Standards</p>
    <p>
      Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
      include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Using welcoming and inclusive language</li>
      <li>Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences</li>
      <li>Gracefully accepting constructive criticism</li>
      <li>Focusing on what is best for the community</li>
      <li>Showing empathy towards other community members</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:</p>
    <ul class="space-y-2">
      <li>
        The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention
        or advances
      </li>
      <li>
        Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political
        attacks
      </li>
      <li>Public or private harassment</li>
      <li>
        Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
        address, without explicit permission
      </li>
      <li>
        Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
        professional setting
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Our Responsibilities</p>
    <p>
      Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of
      acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair
      corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
      Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
      reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other
      contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban
      temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they
      deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.
    </p>

    <p>Scope</p>
    <p>
      This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and it also
      applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in
      public spaces. Examples of representing a project or community include
      using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social
      media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or
      offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and
      clarified by project maintainers.
    </p>

    <p>Enforcement</p>
    <p>
      Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
      reported by contacting the project team at <a
        href="mailto:enquiries@trustedfirmware.org"
        >enquiries@trustedfirmware.org</a
      >.All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a
      response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.
      The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to
      the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement
      policies may be posted separately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in
      good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by
      other members of the project's leadership.
    </p>

    <p>Attribution</p>
    <p>
      This Code of Conduct is adapted from the <a
        href="https://www.contributor-covenant.org/">Contributor Covenant</a

    </p>

    <p>Inclusive Language Policy</p>
    <p>
      TrustedFirmware.org has strict policy that requires use of inclusive
      language in all the projects which are part this organization. Any
      terminology that is against this policy is banned from being used in any
      part of TrustedFirmware.org.
    </p>

    <p>General terms</p>
    <p>
      Terms listed here may not normally be part of code but are barred from use
      within the project regardless.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Blackball</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Coding Standard Addition</p>
    <p>
      Maintainers are required to adopt the specific addition below to their
      coding guidelines and ensure adherence to it. Project has code and
      documents which predate this policy and the current guideline does not
      mandate a retrospective action
    </p>
    <p>
      The use of the terms "blacklist / whitelist" and "master / slave" in code
      and documentation is considered deprecated and should be avoided for new
      submissions. The former can usually be substituted with"blocklist /
      allowlist". Suitable substitutes for the latter should beselected based on
      the individual situation. Common examples include"controller /
      peripheral", "host / device", "initiator / target" or"main /
      secondary".Exceptions can be made in cases where the code or documentation
      is directly referring to hardware that already uses these terms (e.g. in
      register names) or to a common industry standard (until an updated version
      of that standard avoiding these terms is available).
